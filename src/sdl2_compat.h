 *  of SIMD operations (like SSE2, for example). SDL_AudioCVT doesn't require
 *  you to pass it aligned data, but can possibly run much faster if you
 *  set both its (buf) field to a pointer that is aligned to 16 bytes, and its
 *  (len) field to something that's a multiple of 16, if possible.

   at aligned locations otherwise they will become invalid, and thus structs
   containing pointers cannot be packed without giving a warning or error.
   vvv
   The next time we rev the ABI, make sure to size the ints and add padding.
